README

For the aklu-lionheart kernel, use the arch/arm/aklu_jf_defconfig file for your build.
This was designed to be used on a Samsung Galaxy S4, SGH-M919, T-Mobile phone (JFLTETMO), but may be used on other JF variants. It was sucessfully tested on an i9505, and a JFLTEAIO.

Feel free to use any of this material!
